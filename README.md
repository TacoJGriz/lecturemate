### LectureMate App by Jackson Grizzle
This project was never fully finished due to time constraints but the point of it anyway was to 
demonstrate proficiency in Android Studios and working with APIs (I used AWS S3 and Transcribe).
This project was started on April 4th, 2023, and finished on May 15th, 2023. All old commits have been deleted to hide an API Key. Whoops haha
